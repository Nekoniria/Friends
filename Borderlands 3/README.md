# Borderlands 3 Install Guide

**Note: This is the first game I will be doing for now, other games will have its own folder with a README file.**

1. Download `Borderlands 3`
2. Download [D3D11](https://github.com/FromDarkHell/BL3DX11Injection/releases/download/v1.1.3/D3D11.zip)
3. Download [OpenHotfixLoader](https://github.com/apple1417/OpenHotfixLoader/releases/download/v1.6/OpenHotfixLoader.zip)
4. Launch the game at least once
5. Open Steam and right click on `Borderlands 3`
    - Click on Properties
	- Next go to `Local Files`(`Installed Files` if you have the Steam beta active at this time.)
	- Click on `Browse` *This should take you to the Borderlands 3 Directory*
	- Your **File Manager** will start blinking, open that to foreground
	- Please follow this file path `.../OakGame/Binaries/Win64`
	- You should see a `Borderlands3.exe` you made it to the `.exe` almost there!
6. Extract the `D3D11` file into where the `Borderlands3.exe`
7. Extract the `OpenHotfixLoader` in the same place (Make sure the files inside are a `Plugins Folder`, `Borderlands3.exe`, and `d3d11.dll` inside where you extracted)

# Hello Friends!

### Opening Statement

Hello friend or friends, it seems you were linked to this github for modding purposes to make it easy for me to update mods on the fly and easy for YOU to download them whenever you need them.
Here I will give you a step by step guide on how to download/install/run all the mods I put together for us. *Anyone that happens to run into this repository feel free to install these chaos modpacks I have setup for my friends*

## List of games

The list of games I will be modding with my friends will be shown below:

* A Hat in Time
* Borderlands 2
* Borderlands 3
* Call of Duty Black Ops 3 Zombies (Maybe???)
* Dont Starve Together
* The Escapists 2????
* Hollow Knight (Silksong maybe? Someday?)
* Minecraft
* Risk of Rain 2
* Satisfactory
* The Sims 5 (Maybe? Who Knows?)
* Stardew Valley
* And maybe some new games down the line

*To install mods for whatever game were playing at the time, click on the folder of the game name above and select the `README.md` file on how to install the mods*

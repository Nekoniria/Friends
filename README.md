# Hello Friends!

### Opening Statement

Hello friend or friends, it seems you were linked to this github for modding purposes to make it easy for me to update mods on the fly and easy for YOU to download them whenever you need them.
Here I will give you a step by step guide on how to download/install/run all the mods I put together for us. *Anyone that happens to run into this repository feel free to install these chaos modpacks I have setup for my friends*

## List of games

The list of games I will be modding with my friends will be shown below:

* A Hat in Time
* Borderlands 2
* Borderlands 3
* Call of Duty Black Ops 3 Zombies (Maybe???)
* Dont Starve Together
* The Escapists 2????
* Hollow Knight (Silksong maybe? Someday?)
* Minecraft
* Risk of Rain 2
* Satisfactory
* The Sims 5 (Maybe? Who Knows?)
* Stardew Valley
* And maybe some new games down the line

### Borderlands 3 Install Guide

**Note: This is the first game I will be doing for now, other games will have its own folder with a README file.**

1. Download `Borderlands 3`
2. Download [D3D11](https://github.com/FromDarkHell/BL3DX11Injection/releases/download/v1.1.3/D3D11.zip)
3. Download [OpenHotfixLoader](https://github.com/apple1417/OpenHotfixLoader/releases/download/v1.6/OpenHotfixLoader.zip)
4. Launch the game at least once
5. Open Steam and right click on `Borderlands 3`
    - Click on Properties
	- Next go to `Local Files`(`Installed Files` if you have the beta active at this time.)
	- Click on `Browse` *This should take you to the Borderlands 3 Directory*
	- Your **File Manager** will start blinking, open that to foreground
	- Please follow this file path `.../OakGame/Binaries/Win64
	- You should see a `Borderlands3.exe` you made it to the `.exe` almost there!
6. Extract the `D3D11` file into where the `Borderlands3.exe`
7. Extract the `OpenHotfixLoader` in the same place (Make sure the files inside are a `Plugins Folder`, `Borderlands3.exe`, and `d3d11.dll`)
